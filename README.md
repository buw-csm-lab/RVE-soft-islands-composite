# Contents

The Abaqus Python code `RVE_soft_islands.py`  generates representative volume elements of multi-layer composites structured with embedded islands and stable cracks. It provides the framework to study the composites's stretchability and deformation mechanisms using finite element modelling.

The script is ready to use in Abaqus CAE finite elements software and generates a fully parameterized representative volume element of a soft islands-patterned microstructure. Geometry, material and discretization parameters can be changed by the user in the `Variables` section of the script.

The code automatically generates RVEs for all input parameter combinations and handles meshing and application of the boundary conditions as specified.
